make all the sections full page width and height, and make the navbar sticky

I'll create a short todo plan and then read index.html and main.scss to find the navbar and section selectors to update. Expected outcome: identify where to change CSS and then apply edits to make sections full-page and the navbar sticky. I'll mark the first todo as in-progress now.

Created 4 todos

I'll read the key files to find selectors to change: index.html and main.scss.

Read index.html

Now I'll open the stylesheet main.scss to see current styles.

Read main.scss

I'll mark the inspection todo completed and start the CSS update todo, then patch main.scss to add the full-page section and sticky navbar styles. After that I'll run a quick error check.

Starting (2/4) Update CSS for layout

Now I'll apply a patch to main.scss to implement the changes: make body and html full width/height, style #navbar as sticky, and ensure #section1..3 occupy full viewport and remove default margins/padding. Expect to add responsive tweaks.

main.scss+69-1
I've updated the stylesheet. Next I'll mark the CSS update todo completed and start the HTML adjustment todo (likely just verifying anchors and structure). Then I'll open index.html to see if any structural changes are needed.

Starting (3/4) Adjust HTML if needed

Read index.html

HTML structure is fine — no edits required. I'll mark the HTML todo completed and run a quick smoke check by reading the modified CSS and checking for obvious syntax issues. No build system present; we can optionally run a simple browser preview but that's outside tools. I'll mark verification in-progress and run a syntax check via the get_errors tool.

Starting (4/4) Verify and smoke test

Checked main.scss, no problems found

Progress update: I inspected the project files, added the CSS changes to make sections full viewport and make the navbar sticky, and verified there are no syntax errors in the stylesheet. Next: mark verification completed and finish up with a short summary and how to test in a browser. I'll update the todo list to mark final item completed.

Completed (4/4) Verify and smoke test

I updated the project so each content section fills the full viewport and the navbar is sticky at the top.

What I changed

Edited main.scss to:
Make html/body full width/height and reset margins/padding.
Make #navbar sticky (position: sticky; top: 0) with a light background and padding.
Make any element whose id starts with "section" (e.g., #section1, #section2, #section3) span the full viewport height and width (min-height: 100vh; width: 100vw) and center its content.
Add responsive image rules and a small :target offset to avoid the sticky navbar covering anchored sections.
Files changed

main.scss — added full-page section layout and sticky navbar styles.
How to verify locally

Open index.html in your browser (double-click or use Live Preview). The navbar should stick to the top when you scroll; each section should occupy the full browser viewport. In-page links (e.g., clicking a navbar link) will scroll to the corresponding section, and the small offset prevents the navbar from covering the section heading.
Notes and small assumptions

I targeted the existing markup which uses div elements with ids section1, section2, section3. No HTML changes were needed.
I used div[id^="section"] so additional sections with ids starting section will automatically receive the full-page styling.
The :target offset uses an approximate navbar height (68px). If your navbar height differs, adjust that value in the stylesheet.
If you want next

I can switch the divs to semantic <section> elements and update styles accordingly.
I can add a smooth-scroll behavior (CSS or small JS) so clicking navbar links animates the scroll.
I can refine the navbar styling (responsive collapse, active link highlighting) if you'd like.
